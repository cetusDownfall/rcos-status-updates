## Last Week's Accomplishments
Stub filters/resonators definitely seem like a technique that would work.
Frequency range they are used in matches part of our target range(s).

## This Week's Plan
Double check cavity filters, explore equations of stub resonance and maybe
draw out or determine measurements of strips.

## Anything Blocking?
It doesn't seem very easy to prototype stripline based stub filters...
