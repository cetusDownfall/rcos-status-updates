## Last Week's Accomplishments
Learned about how some filters work (did in a class)
Confirmed that there is a way to make a filter of some sort with copper pipe and a bolt.

## This Week's Plan
Analyse the current circuit to see if I can understand it with my very basic knowledge.
Double check to see if the copper pipe filter is usable.
Do calculations to see what components we can use to filter out frequencies we want from the signal.

## Anything Blocking?
Lack of knowledge regarding electrical signals and high frequency radio signals.
LTSpice does not have TI components. Need to find equivalent.

## Notes
Maybe research a better antenna?
