## Last Week's Accomplishments
Began analysing previous circuits to see how their signal filtering works, mostly asking:
	How do the equations work out?
	How can the circuit be modified to be more precise and apply to different freqs?

## This Week's Plan
Try to identify what each component is doing in the previous circuit designs.

## Anything Blocking?

## Notes
