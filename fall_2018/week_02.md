## Last Week's Accomplishments
Confirmed availability of RF lab/shop at W2SZ

## This Week's Plan
Simulation work with SPICE? See if different circuits on the schematic can be built and simulated accurately.
Research alternate power detector chips (bigger/premounted).

## Anything Blocking?
Circuit is "in fact, very broken." The prototype built so far is unreliable and noisy.

## Notes
Antenna improvements?
